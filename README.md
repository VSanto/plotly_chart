### In Conclusion
This challenge was difficult for me.  I had tons of error.  Somehow, I changed the index, had to go back to the module to download the index code again.  The biggest obstacle I had was getting the charts to load.  My tutor helped me out.  Having the files in the static folder seemed to be the issue.  Moving the charts.js and samples.json files out of the static folder worked.  The webpage loaded.  I am getting better at understanding the errors.  Really need to work on my spelling.  All in all this was a fun challenge.
